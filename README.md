## Getting started

Clone this repository, then open it with a code editor and execute the command `npm install`.

> If the dependencies are not installed with the above command, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) on your machine.

## Run a server

To run a server on _development mode_ you need to execute:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

To be able to visualize the dev server running, you must open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

> By default, the utilized port will be 3000, but this can be configured and changed for other port.

To build the system for production you must execute:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To run a server on _production mode_ you need to execute:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Repository edit

The repository's root path is `pages/index.tsx`. All folder structures and page files within are automatically routed and converted to equivalently named _endpoints_. When changes are made to a file, the open server is automatically updated when the changes are saved.

Each new component must be created inside the `components` folder. These are server-side rendered when they are called on any of the pages. Suppose we have a component called "Dropdown", it will be rendered on a page that contains the `<Dropdown />` tag.

The `pages/api` subfolder is mapped to the path `/api/*`. The files in this folder are taken by Next as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. To access any route API, the respective endpoint must be placed. Example, for the file `pages/api/test.ts`, the path [http://localhost:3000/api/test](http://localhost:3000/api/test) corresponds to it.
