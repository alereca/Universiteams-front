## Getting started

### Nodejs

Clone this repository, then open it with a code editor and execute the command `npm install`.

> If the dependencies are not installed with the above command, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) on your machine.

### Make

Only in case you happen to use Windows install [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/install)
Then install Make with the following command:

```bash
$ choco install make
```

## Run a server

To run a server on _development mode_ you need to execute:

```bash
make dev
```

To be able to visualize the dev server running, you must open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

> By default, the utilized port will be 3000, but this can be configured and changed for other port.

To build the system for production you must execute:

```bash
make build
```

To run a server on _production mode_ you need to execute:

```bash
make prod
```

## Repository edit

The repository's root path is `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Each new component must be created inside the `components` folder. These are server-side rendered when they are called on any of the pages. Suppose we have a component called "Dropdown", it will be rendered on a page that contains the `<Dropdown />` tag.
